                        <strong><em>*NEW COVID enhanced cleaning protocol*</em></strong><br>
                        
                        This tiny cabin has modern touches making you feel right at home: bed, small sitting area, and dining table. A covered porch with an outdoor kitchenette and lounge chairs overlooking the lake. A fire pit, an outdoor shower, a clean airy outhouse, and your own dock to swim, canoe and watch the sunrise and sunset; absolute perfection.
                        
                   
                        <br>
                        <em>PLEASE READ *IMPORTANT* INFO:</em><br>
                        
                        Below, we have worked to give you the clearest picture of what to expect from the space and your stay. Any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us :)
                        
                        Your Suite Island Retreat, aka The Bunkie, neighbours our cottage, the only two places on the island, but enjoys its own private setting facing the lake. We each have our own private docks on different sides of the island. There is a common space behind the Bunkie and our cottage where you'll find a badminton net and rackets, that you are free to use :)
                        
                        As there isn't anywhere to walk on the island, the dock in front of the Bunkie is for your use and offers the freedom to travel by water. A canoe is provided with life jackets and safety kit. This beautiful lake has many islands and lots of nooks and crannies to explore (always travel with a phone/GPS). You may want to consider bringing with you a SUP board for some extra fun, or a floating water toy. Water toys are available to rent in Lakefield, the nearest town, at Cottage Toys.
                        
                        A short paddle away you'll find two short walking trails (map provided). It is recommended that you bring your phone/GPS and stay on the well-marked path, as you will be surrounded by miles and miles of crown land.
                        
                        On weekends, and sometimes weekdays, we will be sharing the island with you. Our back deck and bbq can be in earshot of your Bunkie depending on wind, etc. We aren't rowdy partiers but occasionally we have friends up. We will let you know :) Our fire pit is on the other side of the island and noise can't be heard from this area of the island.
                        
                        Respecting your privacy is our top priority. Yet we also love meeting new people and are open to sharing a drink should the timing work for everyone.
                        
                        Please note, we have a dog, Daisy, a golden doodle, who is friendly and easy-going. If a dog is a deal-breaker for you, contact us before booking and we may be able to arrange a no-dog stay for you. Otherwise, due to the island experience, when we are on the island, we can't keep her from popping over to meet you. Although we have a dog we don’t allow pets at the Bunkie.
                        
                        We request that our guests be adults and that only 2 occupants visit at one time. If a parent and older child would like to stay, contact us and let us know.
                        
                        Note and reminder: the Suite Island Retreat is for those who want a quiet getaway. It is not a party place, and fireworks are not permitted. Be aware that sound can carry across the lake, especially when the lake is still and quiet.
                        <br>
                        <strong><em>THE AREA:</em></strong><br> 
                        
                        The Bunkie is located on an island at the end of a bay with lots of privacy. To the East, the island is surrounded by crown land and to the West, and one diagonally across from the Bunkie, we have a sprinkling of friendly cottagers'.
                        
                        It is important to note that peak season there is more boat traffic going by, whether it is the odd speed boat going for a zip around the lake, people cruising or fishing.
                        <br>
                        <strong><em>GETTING THERE:</em></strong><br> 
                        
                        Parking is at Stony Point Marina (easy to find on Google Maps), we have a designated parking spot for you.
                        <hr>
                        Options getting to and from the Island:<br>
                        Water Taxi: We pick you up and drop you off at both ends of your stay. It's about a 10min boat ride.
                        <br>
                        Canoe: Bring your own canoe and paddle in, it’s about 45 min at a relaxed pace.
                        <br>
                        Boat: Bring your own boat. Note: this lake is very rocky and not always marked. Give plenty of space around markers, travel with care. Please respect clean boat etiquette, to avoid bringing any unwanted marina life into the lake.
                        <br>
                        If all of this sounds like something you would enjoy, we look forward to hearing from you and sharing this beautiful piece of paradise! Contact us with any questions.

                        Guest access: the Bunkie area and our Cottage space are somewhat defined. Common sense prevails in respecting space and privacy :)
